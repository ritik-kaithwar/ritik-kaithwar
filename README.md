🎯 **Data Analyst | SQL | Excel | Power BI | Python | Data Engineering | Machine Learning**  

👋 Hi, I’m **Ritik Kaithwar** — a Data Analyst **exploring the intersection of business and data** to turn raw information into meaningful insights.  

I’ve worked on projects that span from **building interactive dashboards in Power BI & Excel**, to **designing predictive models in Python**, to **querying large datasets with SQL**. Along the way, I leverage tools like **AWS** to handle data at scale and deliver solutions that support smarter decisions — with a growing focus on **automation to simplify repetitive tasks**.
